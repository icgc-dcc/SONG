Project containing both the SONG microservice and CLI client. 
Both are written using JAVA 8 and Spring Boot. 

## Build

```bash
$ mvn clean package
```

## Running


#### Command-line

The source can be built and run using maven.

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:icgc-dcc/SONG.git
$ cd SONG/song-server
$ mvn spring-boot:run -Drun.profiles=dev,test
```

Both the server and client when compiled and built produce  uber jars which can be run easily from the command line.

```bash
$ java -jar song-server-0.1.1-SNAPSHOT.jar  --spring.profiles.active=dev,test
```

## API

The server provides swagger docs documenting the API. 

When running locally they can be accessed here: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html



### Notes

When running with the secure profile enabled, an oauth2 server is needed.
